ARTES is a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for polarized scattered light simulations of exoplanet atmospheres. The code can be used for post-processing of a pre-calculated or parametrized atmosphere structure. Multiple scattering, absorption, and polarization are fully treated and the output includes an image, spectrum, or phase curve of reflected stellar light or thermal photons. Several tools are included for calculating opacities and scattering matrices of molecules and clouds but the user can also adopt their own opacities.
