ARTES is a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code specifically designed for (polarized) scattered light simulations of planetary atmospheres. Computations of both reflected stellar light and thermal emission from the planet are possible for an arbitrary atmospheric structure and distribution of opacity sources. Multiple scattering, absorption, and polarization are fully treated and the output includes an image, spectrum, or phase curve. Several tools are included to create opacities and scattering matrices for molecules and clouds.
